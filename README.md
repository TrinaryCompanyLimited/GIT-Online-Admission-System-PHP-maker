# GIT-Online-Admission-System-PHP-maker
PHP maker web application

This project is birth to a semester project work that I did in Internet Enabled Application Systems 
Development. Its an online admission system which I built with PHPMaker. Due to my passion to see Ghana and Africa 
as a whole advance technologically revived the interest for me to develop this application. My hope is that Ghana could 
build an institution such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or the Indian Institute Of Technology to help transform 
the African continent.
